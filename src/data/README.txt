The 140k real or fake faces dataset should be within this directory. Due to the large size of the dataset, there is nothing here normally.
The dataset has multiple directories within itself. You need to remove most of the outter directories until you reach a directory called 'real-vs-fake'.
Extract the 'real-vs-fake' directory into THIS directory location. The path should look like this: (src/data/real-vs-fake/...)

The train.csv, test.csv, valid.csv are NOT necessary. These files already exist within the src/Util/Labels directory.
